# AI EXERCISE TUTOR FOR DISABLED

## Technology used:
    Use the RESTAPI and CHATGPT APIs to make game recommendations.
    This game recommendation system is highly effective because it combines artificial intelligence and personal interests with immediate user feedback.
## Reasons for development

    This recommendation system was created for several reasons:

    1. **Personalization**: In a world full of choices, personalization is key. People are more likely to engage with content or products that are tailored to their interests and past behavior. This system leverages a user's YouTube subscription information and uses advanced AI techniques to recommend games that are likely to be of interest to them.

    2. **Enhancing User Experience**: It helps in enhancing the user experience by saving users' time and effort in finding games that they might like. Instead of browsing through an endless list of games, users get a curated list of recommendations.

    3. **Helping Game Developers**: It also helps game developers and publishers by driving traffic to their games that might otherwise get lost in the sea of available options.

    4. **Utilizing Advanced Technology**: It is an innovative way to utilize advanced technologies like the YouTube API, ChatGPT, and Daum API to create a useful application. It's an example of how different technologies can be combined to create a personalized and user-friendly experience.
